## Description

Web application for ear training, music theory on the topic "Musical intervals". The design was implemented for a mobile phone user audience with the idea that it would be easiest to use the product on the go or somewhere where you want to kill time.

The idea for the project arose when at school we began to study this topic and there were similar tasks for specifying the correct interval. This app can help in practice: to train the eye and ears.

### Customization

The user can choose:

- number of assignments
- type of clef, which will be encountered during the game
- sharp, flat, or clear notes
- on the staff or audio only.

The assignments are generated, according to the settings, and are prompted to specify this minor/major, second/third/sixth/seventh interval.

### Tasks generation

The learning technique is inspired by [spaced repetitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition). In the beginning, the user is presented with simple tasks, such as minor intervals with only whole notes, then it gets more and more complicated. If a person answers incorrectly, the type of such question is memorized and will be shown from time to time to train exactly the weak points.

### Results

At the end of the completion of all tasks, the user is shown the statistics of the current game:

- how many correct answers
- how many wrong answers
- how many right answers in a row
- how much time has been spent
- the average time to complete one task

In the end we get a product that already works and can be further developed into other topics of music theory, which can help many people who are engaged in music.
